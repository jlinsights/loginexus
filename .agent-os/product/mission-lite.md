# Product Mission (Lite)

LogiNexus is a multi-tenant enterprise logistics platform that helps freight forwarders, shippers, and 3PL providers manage shipments, track cargo, and secure payments on-chain by providing a unified dashboard with blockchain-powered escrow and AI-driven insights.

LogiNexus serves global logistics operators who need centralized shipment visibility across carriers, trustless payment settlement via USDC smart contract escrow, and white-labeled platform experiences for their own customers. Unlike traditional logistics SaaS, LogiNexus combines multi-tenant isolation with on-chain payment security and AI-powered intelligence.
